## Codebase Patterns
- Database file stored as auth_helper.db in project root (auto-creates on first run)
- All database operations in src/database.py
- Pydantic models for validation in src/models.py
- CRUD operations in src/crud.py
- OTP generation logic in src/otp.py
- QR code parsing in src/qr.py
- FastAPI endpoints in src/main.py with exception handlers

## 2026-01-31 - US-001 (Commit: d77216b)
- Created requirements.txt with all dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, pyotp, pyzbar, Pillow, python-multipart, pytest, httpx)
- Created .gitignore for venv/, __pycache__/, *.pyc, *.db
- Created src/ directory structure for application code
- Added comprehensive README.md with setup instructions, prerequisites (libzbar0), and API examples
- Created run.sh script for easy service startup (activates venv, installs deps, runs uvicorn)
- Installed Python 3.12-venv and libzbar0 system packages
- Set up Python virtual environment with all dependencies installed
- Files changed: requirements.txt, .gitignore, README.md, run.sh, src/__init__.py, progress.txt
- **Patterns added to Codebase Patterns:** Database file location (auth_helper.db), module structure
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - System requires libzbar0 for QR code scanning
  - Virtual environment activation in run.sh uses source venv/bin/activate
